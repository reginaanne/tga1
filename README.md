# Project organization
This project primarily used standalone R and bash scripts. Scripts and supporting materials have been organized by analysis, including those for estimation of mutational age using Relate, local ancestry inference in heterozygous teosinte individuals using ELAI, haplotype visualization combining Haplostrips and custom scripts, and simulations using SLiM and msprime. 

# Data availability
The ZEAMAP dataset used for this project can be accessed online at https://ftp.cngb.org/pub/CNSA/data3/CNP0001565/zeamap/02_Variants/PAN_Zea_Variants/Zea-vardb/.
